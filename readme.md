This is my custom item filter for [Path of Exile](https://www.pathofexile.com/). For general information about item filters, see the [item filter guide on the community wiki](https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/Guide:Item_filter_guide). I started my own item filter almost as soon as they were added in Path of Exile: The Awakening (version 2.0.0) in 2015 because I wasn't satisfied with how other player created item filters looked. Over the years, they've grown into an opinionated set of filters that appeal to my aesthetics while cutting through the loot noise.

# Installation

## Following the filters for automatic updates

The recommended way to install these is logging into your account on [the Path
of Exile website](https://www.pathofexile.com) and then [clicking *Follow* on
one or more filters on my
profile](https://www.pathofexile.com/account/view-profile/AmbientImpact/item-filters),
which will cause the game to automatically download and update the item filters
next time it's started or restarted. Once you've done that, you can optionally
[download and install the sound files](#sound-files) which must be done
manually.

## Manual download

You can download either a development snapshot or one of the tagged releases if
you prefer the tedious route or don't care about updating.

## Finding the item filter folder

# Sound files

The optional sound files are found in the
[AmbientImpactItemFilter/sounds](/AmbientImpactItemFilter/sounds) folder. Note
that you must place the sound files in that exact folder path relative to your
item filter folder for the game to load the sounds. This means that inside of
[your item filter folder](#finding-the-item-filter-folder) there must be a
`AmbientImpactItemFilter` folder, and within that folder there must be a
`sounds` folder containing the sound files.
