This is my custom item filter for [Path of Exile](https://www.pathofexile.com/). For general information about item filters, see the [item filter guide on the community wiki](https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/Guide:Item_filter_guide). I started my own item filter almost as soon as they were added in Path of Exile: The Awakening (version 2.0.0) in 2015 because I wasn't satisfied with how other player created item filters looked. Over the years, they've grown into an opinionated set of filters that appeal to my aesthetics while cutting through the loot noise.
